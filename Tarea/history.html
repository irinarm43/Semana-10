			The Warped Tour was created in 1995 by Kevin Lyman, in production with the short lived Warp Magazine and Creative Artists Agency. The tour began June 21 at the Idaho Center in Boise, Idaho, and ended August 18 in Detroit. 
			<br><br>
			The tour has always been held at outdoor venues though on a rare occasions that has not always been the case. In 1996, due to problems with the venue where the event was to be held, the show was forced to be moved indoors to The Capitol Ballroom nightclub in Washington DC.
			<br><br>
			1996 was the first year for Vans as a sponsor and they have been the main sponsor ever since carrying their name in the title. In 1998, the tour went international, including venues in Australia, Japan, Europe, Canada, and the United States.In 1999, the tour started off in New Zealand, Australia and Hawaii in the New Year. It then started up again in the United States for the northern hemisphere summer before ending up in Europe. The Vans Warped Tour has turned eco-friendly by using biodiesel for the production buses.	In 2009, the two main stages were condensed into one and bands were given 40-minute sets, as opposed to the traditional 30 minutes across the previous two stages. Despite this, the tour decided to bring back the two main stages concept with 35-minute sets instead for the 2012 tour and beyond. In 2012, the Warped Tour traveled to London, the first time the tour has left North America since 1999. In the UK and Europe, Warped Tour is operated by English promoter Kilimanjaro Live.The Warped Tour returned to London in 2015.</p>
